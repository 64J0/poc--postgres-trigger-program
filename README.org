#+TITLE: [POC] Postgres trigger program
#+DATE: [2024-12-26 qui]

The idea it to create an HTTP Rest API to interact with the user.

This user will be able to POST requests scheduling the execution of
programs. This will be mapped into a database (PostgreSQL) table so we keep the
history of those operations.

Other than this, the user will be able to:

- Register new scripts;
- List scripts that are already registered.

Then, whenever this execution table is updated it will notify a second
application, running a MailboxProcessor that will be responsible for running
these scripts and collecting their output (both success and failure).
