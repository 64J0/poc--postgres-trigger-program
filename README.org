#+TITLE: [POC] Postgres trigger program
#+DATE: [2024-12-26 qui]

The idea is to create a multi-service application composed of 1) an HTTP Rest
API to interact with the user, 2) a Postgres database to store the data and 3) a
background application leveraging a MailboxProcessor that is notified by the
database whenever a new ~program_execution~ entity is created and it's used to
run the specified program, collect its output and update the database.

Other than this, the user will be able to:

- Register new scripts;
- List scripts that are already registered.

** How to run

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :tangle no
  # 1st shell
  #
  # start the database container with
  docker compose up -d postgres

  # if you need to restart it use
  #
  # docker compose down
  # docker compose up -d postgres
  #
  # check the logs with
  #
  # docker container logs -f postgres_container

  # Start the API with
  dotnet run --define:DEBUG --project api/

  # ===============================================
  # 2nd shell
  #
  # start the manager process
  dotnet run --define:DEBUG --project manager/

  # ===============================================
  # 3rd shell
  #
  # start playing with the API and check the logs from the manager process
  #
  # TODO: break this request into two: 1) create the script entity, 2) uploads the script.
